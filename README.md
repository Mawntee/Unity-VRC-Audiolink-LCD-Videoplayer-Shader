# Unity-VRC-Audiolink-LCD-Videoplayer-Shader

Example Video: https://streamable.com/q9db5n

Important notes:
- Requires Audiolink to be imported, and in your project to work!
- Default distance settings should be ideal for VR use. The only thing you should need to mess with is UV scaling, pixel size, and any Audiolink parameters! 
- Audiolink can be disabled simply by setting all the sliders to 0, and switching "Add - Multiply" toggles to off (add)
- Currently, instancing is not supported, so a new material will have to be made for each unique display effect.
